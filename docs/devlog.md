# Development log

Times are Europe/Berlin. Secrets are never written here.

## Fri 23 Oct 2026: Data layer
- Installed Zetaris locally (zetaris-platform v2.4.3, UI on port 3000, REST API on 8888).
- Created the admin account and API key; ran the PokeAPI recipe (Lightning database POKEAPI_REST).
- getting-started preflight: PASS (REST datasources HTTP 200, SELECT 1). Lightning DBs: NY_TAXI, POKEAPI_REST, TPCDS_DB.

## Sat 24 Oct 2026: Build tool
- Organisers made Cursor optional (Discord, 22 Oct). Chose Claude Code (existing subscription).
- Claude Code: user settings deny reading .env files; Manual permission mode by default.
- Claude Code in getting-started: read-only REST check passed (SELECT 1, SHOW LIGHTNING DATABASES).

## Sun 25 Oct 2026: Power layer and repo
- Installed Nightshift (Mac M1-M4 edition). NVIDIA key stored in Nightshift Providers only.
- Lanes: Race = Nemotron 3.5 Bolt E4B, Nemotron 3.5 Lightning 30B A3B, Nemotron 3 Ultra 550B A55B; Verify = Lightning.
- Runtime tests (http://127.0.0.1:8088/v1):
  - GET /v1/models: routing modes and Nemotron models listed.
  - Chat on meterless/auto: OK, routed to Bolt E4B, provider nvidia, receipt status ok.
  - Lightning by exact model id with a run_sql tool: returned a proper tool call.
  - Ultra by exact model id: OK, but output contains reasoning text before "</think>"; the client must strip it.
- Decision: pin models by exact id (see docs/decisions/0001-pin-nemotron-models.md).
- Risk noted: NVIDIA free tier is limited to 40 requests/minute; app will use a shared rate limiter, 429 retries and a call budget.
- Created repo supplier-risk with uv (Python 3.12), .gitignore and .env.example.
- Build check (setup guide 3.1): Claude Code created hello.py, ran `uv run python hello.py` (output: hello), then deleted it.
